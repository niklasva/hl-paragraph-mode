** Installation
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(add-to-list 'load-path "/path/to/hl-paragraph-mode")
(require 'hl-paragraph-mode)
#+end_src

** Usage
~(hl-paragraph-mode)~ enables the mode locally.
~(hl-paragraph-global-mode)~ enables it globally.

** Customizations
By default ~hl-paragraph-mode~ will highlight the lines in a paragraph.
To change it so only the text inside the paragraph is highlighted, set its value to nil.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq hl-paragraph-highlight-entire-line nil)
#+end_src

The face ~hl-paragraph-face~ can be customized. By default it inherits its attributes from ~hl-line~.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(set-face-attribute 'hl-paragraph-face nil :background "yellow")
#+end_src
This makes the background of the highlighted text yellow.
